# Intro

I am a graduate student at UCSB finishing up my degree in Computer Science. Last year, I graduated from the same university with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. In my spare time, I play badminton with friends, explore new boba shops, and go on sunset walks along the many beaches around our campus.
